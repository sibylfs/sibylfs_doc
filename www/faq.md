  * What exactly is it that the model models? (What is the "essence" of a file system?)
  
  * What sorts of interleaving/concurrency does the model handle? What about two racing writes, can they interleave?
  
  * How is the equivalence partitioning and trace generation implemented?
  
  * Is it surprising that more bugs weren't found, particularly security bugs?
  
  * Why don't you test for concurrent/racy file system bugs?
  
  * How was the model constructed?
