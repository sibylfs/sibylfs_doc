# Introduction

These pages are documentation for the SibylFS project. 

These pages document how to use SibylFS. The paper "SibylFS: formal
specification and oracle-based testing for POSIX and real-world file
systems" <http://www.tom-ridge.com/resources/doc/sosp_draft.pdf> ***should be read first***, particularly sections 1
and 2 which give background and an overview of the system, and section
6 which describes the test suite and harness.
